# Type 2 diabetic and hyperglycemic pancreatic islets (63 patients)
# Analysis of pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetes (T2D) and non-diabetic cadaver donors. Glycemic control (HbA1c) levels also measured from the same individuals (normoglycemic: HbA1c < 6%; hyperglycemic: HbA1c â‰¥ 6%). Results provided insight into molecular basis of islet dysfunction in T2D. [We integrated our data to form a rank list of putative T2D genes, of which CHL1, LRFN2, RASGRP1, and PPM1K were validated in INS-1 cells to influence insulin secretion, whereas GPR120 affected apoptosis in islets. ]
